## Hi there, I'm Omar Elshopky 👋

I am an **offensive security engineer** and **professional penetration tester** with three years of hands-on experience, including two years in cybersecurity and one and a half years focused on software engineering. My expertise spans web, network, and source code review penetration testing. I am particularly passionate about the security of hardware, embedded systems, ICS, and the Internet of Things, with a strong ability to both build and secure these technologies, which I pentest in my own lab.

My solid development background uniquely positions me to help companies secure their infrastructure and digital assets more effectively than others in the field. I have been instrumental in securing critical assets for companies across Egypt, Europe, and the Gulf, and have also played a key role in building penetration testing frameworks, tools and raising cybersecurity awareness. My year of freelancing has further sharpened my business acumen, client management, and project-handling skills. Additionally, I have self-studied business concepts, which I apply in running a side business in additive manufacturing.
